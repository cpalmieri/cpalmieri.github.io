**A Problem:**  
We decide to bring the country selector down to the bottom of the page, to save valuable real estate up top. If you have a long list of countries, the typical dropdown list will make the page get longer, and when the user scrolls to find their country, the dropdown closes back up again, essentially making it unusable.

**A Solution:**  
Make the drop down drop up, with a little bit of [Craig&#8217;s][3] Javascript magic. Page doesn&#8217;t get longer or scroll, and the entire list is visible and clickable.

[Try it out!][4]
