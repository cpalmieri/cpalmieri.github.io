[![][1]][2]In case you haven&#8217;t heard, the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe resigned last week, three days into the new parliamentary session, and way to far into a comically long string of corruption scandals. He immediately checked himself into a hospital for &#8220;stress related stomach problems&#8221;, neatly avoiding the inevitable shitstorm.

Aera, a weekly general interest magazine, managed to capture all this in one gutsy crop. Now that&#8217;s editorial design!
