[![][1]][2]Okayama Prefecture [took over the Ginza line][2] a few weeks ago with these ads. The concept is simple. They asked a bunch of locals and visitors what they want to &#8220;push&#8221; about Okayama. Each was presumably given one of these big posters and a handful of markers. 

[![][3]][2]I really like [the series][2] for a few reasons: 

  * [![][4]][2]They&#8217;re authentic. I walked up and down the carriages and couldn&#8217;t find any duplicates. Some are even signed: &#8220;A. Maeda, age 80&#8243;. Because of the gloss of the paper, it was hard to tell if the handdrawn designs were scanned and offset printed, but it sure didn&#8217;t look like it.
  * The choice of markers that were passed out (mostly black and red) was just enough to establish some aesthetic consistency across the series, without the need for a designer to rein in the personal drawing and writing styles with heavy handed graphic effects.
