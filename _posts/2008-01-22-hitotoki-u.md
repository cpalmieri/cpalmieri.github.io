It appears that Temple University&#8217;s [Intermediate Topics in Media and Telecommunication Production][1] course is using Hitotoki as inspiration for one of its assignments. 

There aren&#8217;t many details to chew on, but I&#8217;m really happy to know that Hitotoki has matured enough to inspire this kind of repurposing. Can&#8217;t wait to see what else 2008 has in store for the project.

Oh, and for those of you live in a dark hole with nothing to sustain you other than cave wall condensation and this rss feed, we are throwing a [Hitotoki Party in Tokyo next week][2]!
