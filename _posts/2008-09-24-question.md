Today, a few hours after an unsatisfying lunch at around 3 o&#8217;clock, I left the office for a nearby convenience store, to pick up a snack for me and one for Eiko. 

I ate my entire snack before arriving back at the office. Upon my return, I immediately went to the kitchen and threw away my plastic wrappers, then returned to the work room to give Eiko a carmelized custard.

So then how, with no clues from me visual or otherwise, did she, on our way home, correctly guess that among the hundreds of edible choices available at the convenience store, I ate one onigiri and one cream puff? 

I have no regular pattern of buying choux cremes or onigiri from the convenience store, and in fact buy nothing but chocolate 80% of the time.
