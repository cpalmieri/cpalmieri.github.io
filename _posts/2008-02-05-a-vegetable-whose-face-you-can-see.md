[![][1]][2]These veggies showed up at my local Ito Yokado about a year ago. Each one has a line drawing of the (Japanese) face and name of the farmer responsible for the crop. 

I&#8217;m not certain there&#8217;s a significant difference in quality, but it&#8217;s a clever way to calm food source paranoias in a country where American beef with spinal tissue and frozen Chinese dumplings laced with rat poison lead the nightly news.
