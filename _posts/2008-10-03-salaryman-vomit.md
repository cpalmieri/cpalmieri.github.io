[![][1]][2]Tokyo Metro has been making &#8220;subway manners&#8221; posters since 1974 to promote a harmonious riding experience. These posters have focused on just a handful of rules: don&#8217;t apply cosmetics on the train, don&#8217;t take up too much space, don&#8217;t play loud music. But they always seem to avoid the subject of [this guy][3] or for that matter [this fella][3], or [this chap][4]. 

So when [the latest round of clever posters][5] came out, this time with a creepy little salaryman silently passing judgment on all, [us gaijin][6] [couldn&#8217;t help ourselves][2]
