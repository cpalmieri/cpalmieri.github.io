Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t make this a habit.

  * For now, it&#8217;s keeping up nicely, only ever feels sluggish when Parallels is booting up or shutting down.
  * Runs Photoshop like a dream. I now know that the remaining annoyance, chokes on &#8220;Save for Web&#8221;, are CS&#8217;s fault and not my Mac&#8217;s.
  * I was on 10.4 on my last machine, so I&#8217;m happy to have a version of spotlight that works.
  * The keyboard is nice, but the key&#8217;s, especially the space bar, are less firm and noisier than the Apple keyboard.
  * The no-button takes too much pressure for a click. For the first time, I moved to tapping, which is error prone, but less tiresome. 
  * The screen is nice and bright, maybe too much so. Slight differences in very light greys are lost. Maybe this is more in line with other laptops and will keep me away from design nuances that will be lost for most users, but even that unintended benefit is probably a job for CS color profiles.
  * The NVIDIA 9600M GT graphics processor (the lesser of the two) is a P.O.S. When it&#8217;s running, I get random flickers of black, and YouTube videos choke, usually at the moment of truth. Also, when you dim the screen down to the last few bars, it flickers like a dying florescent. If running this processor gave the machine 15 hours of battery life then fine, but it doesn&#8217;t, why would you install something so crappy in something called &#8220;Pro&#8221;?
  * The screen hinge is already too loose after 3 months. 
  * The nasty key prints are even more of an eyesore on the glossy screen. This seems like something that should have been easy to avoid.
