[![marunouchi.png][1]][2]Late March/Early April promises to be a good time for art and design fans, with major auctions, awards, exhibitions and festivals happening throughout the city. 

In January, we started working on a handful of related projects with TAB and Marunouchi to get ready for their respective contributions to the celebration. This week, we finally have something out in the open to show for it, [a one-pager for Marunouchi Art Weeks][3], an umbrella for all the Marunouchi-area art events happening this season. There&#8217;s much more still at the printers, but I couldn&#8217;t wait to share the link.
