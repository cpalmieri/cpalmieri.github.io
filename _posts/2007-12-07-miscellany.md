With this entry I will fulfill blog cliche #23, by giving you a bullet-point list of things happening after a long silence:

  * AQ is working with Firefox on [ a short video contest][1].
  * We&#8217;re going home for Christmas, first time in five years.
  * I fell into a black hole of Kitchen Nightmares watching last month. Theatrics and cursing aside, I really appreeciate Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s sober approach to business. The message I take away from most of the episodes is, if you put sentiment and pride aside to see and accept the immutable realities of your business, the resulting discoveries and changes will make running that business more enjoyable and rewarding in the long run.
  * [This restaurant][2] is doing everything right.
  * So is [this one][3].
  * [TAB][4] is running a Haiku contest.
  * Hitotoki is [launching in London][5].
