Ever since The 4-Hour Workweek, I’ve been hearing a lot about the wisdom in working smart rather than working hard. I work quite a lot, smart enough I think, but with plenty of mistakes as well. What bothers me about the “work smart, not hard” mantra is that it implies that hard work is necessarily an undesirable weakness to be overcome or cured. 

I have a few responses.

**1. Sometimes you need to work hard, even when you are working smart.**

Creative work rarely goes from good to great without some hard work. This doesn’t mean that every job needs to take 500 hours, but some just do. [And the ones that only take 5 minutes][1] often take only 5 minutes because you’ve worked hard at similar tasks years ago and now they come easy. 

There are plenty of other legitimate reasons to work hard, even when you’re working smart: your partner is out sick, you made a mistake, someone else made a mistake, you’re on a roll, etc.

**2. Who wants a 4-hour work week?**

I have no interest in a 4-hour work week, I love my job. I work in a comfortable office with people I respect and care about, doing projects which are enjoyable. 

If the idea of a 4-hour work week is attractive to you, you’ll probably have better luck at happiness by looking for a better job or looking to make your current job more enjoyable than by searching for a way to get rich quick, get other people to do your work for you, or whatever other snake oil this book is selling. 

(It seems like the easiest way to achieve the 4-hour work week is to write a book about the 4-hour work week. Except that someone already did that.)

**3. Working smart is not a bad idea.**

Of course it&#8217;s not. But it does mean different things to different people and professions. For me?

  * Regularly asking myself if I&#8217;m going in the right direction and knowing when to start over and when it’s time to push further
  * Knowing when good enough is good enough and when it isn’t. (* story on inside of box)
  * Knowing when shortcuts are going to end up taking me longer to fix than doing things the right way from the beginning
  * Knowing when asking others for help will save time and when it will cost time
  * Knowing when doing something today will take half the effort it will take tomorrow, and when it will take twice

I learned (and am learning) most of this stuff through experience gained while working hard, as most people probably do. 

Hard work is not necessarily a virtue and certainly not for everyone, but some people (myself included) enjoy it. We may change our mind someday, but in the meantime, skip the lecture and let us get back to work!

* In my college summers, I used to work light construction with my father and uncle. One morning my uncle gave me a tiny closet to paint, and left me be. 

He came back a few hours later to check up, shocked to find me still in the closet, sweatily struggling to get the paint strokes to all go in the same direction. He boasted about how he and my dad used to compete for who could get more apartments painted before lunchtime, and then he told me my closet was fine as is. 

I protested and pointed to the uneven brush marks, when he smiled as his eyebrows arched upwards.

“I have just the thing to fix that.” 

Then he reached up and pulled the little string hanging from the light bulb in the ceiling and the closet went dark.
