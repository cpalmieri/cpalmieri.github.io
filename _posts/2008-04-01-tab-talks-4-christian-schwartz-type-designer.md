[![][1]][2]I&#8217;m going to be hosting [the next TAB Talks][3], featuring a presentation and Q&A with [type designer Christian Schwartz][4]. Christian has created custom typefaces for publications and companies like Esquire, Wallpaper*, The New York Times, Bosch and Deutsche Bahn. His typefaces for the Guardian were an integral part of the newspaper&#8217;s acclaimed redesign in 2005.

The talk will be held in English with Japanese translation, at Gotanda Sonic in Gotanda. Hope to see you there!
