The image of the bottle crushing down into a vase for a little sprig of green is branding genius, memorable and communicative. But why did Coca-Cola make a single product, rather than bottling ALL of its drinks in the lighter bottles? The whole endeavor is either a cynical greenwashing or a gutless baby step. 

They&#8217;re Coke. What&#8217;s stopping them from taking making a bolder move?

p.s. I LOHAS&#8217;s tagline, &#8220;Delicious + Good for the environment&#8221; is a less illegal but no less ugly lie than if Phillip Morris still claimed low tar cigarettes are good for the body.
