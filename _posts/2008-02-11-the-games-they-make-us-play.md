Yesterday I dropped by Bic Camera to trade in Eiko and my 2+ year old au mobile phones for new ones. The purchase was inspired by a &#8220;campaign&#8221; mailer that offered one of several winter 2007 models for free, through a combination of limited-time-only discounts and points. Eiko chose the W53CA, because it has a nice camera and I called dibs on the green Infobar (more on that later). 

The green Infobar was sold out at Bic, so I moved on to Eiko&#8217;s W53CA, flagging down a rep. Before escorting me to his 3-card Monty table, he kindly warned me of the three or four &#8220;optional&#8221; programs I would be \*forced\* to sign up for, regardless of which phone I chose or where I bought it. 

This was the first trade in I&#8217;d done since phone numbers were decoupled from carriers, and little did I know how absurdly complex the process had become since then. In this rant, I won&#8217;t even get into the different minute and packet plans, since they&#8217;ve been around long enough to be beaten on by more knowledgable critics than me. 

**Full Support Course vs. Simple Course**  
As far as I can tell, by buying the phone at the discounted price, I automatically signed up for Full Support. They are essentially supporting you by giving you a ¥21,000 (USD200) discount on the handset&#8217;s invisible retail price, but \*locking you into the carrier and the phone for 2 years\*, with penalty fees if you change either. Additionally, Full Support is the gateway for the standard diner menu of minute/packet plans, whearas the Simple Course, offers just a few cheaper plans with no prepaid minutes or packets. 

Full Support is clearly nothing more than a tactic to scare beloved customers into sticking with au, now that they are no longer locked in. It seems to also be a replacement to the tiered handset pricing scheme that made new phones progressively cheaper the longer you held on to your previous one. 

**Call Designation Discount**  
This &#8220;discount&#8221; option costs ¥300 a month. It allows you a 60% discount on calls made to any three phone numbers. I guess this would allow certain people who call the same numbers all the time to select a cheaper plan with less pre-paid minutes, but even then it&#8217;s hard to know if the numbers would work in your favor since au doesn&#8217;t send detailed call records with your monthly bill. 

I was forced to sign up for this option, but canceled it the next day. At worst, I&#8217;ll be charged the first month&#8217;s ¥300, but I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of customers who forget to cancel, and will now be short pocket change for a night of Karaoke once a year.

**The Waiting Song (Machi-uta)**  
Ever call a friend on Docomo and hear some lame melody trying to make love to the dial tone? That&#8217;s Machi-uta, and it&#8217;s come to au at ¥300 per month. 

I was forced to sign up for this twisted spawn of a focus group gone wrong wrong wrong. I canceled the next day.

**Safe mobile support**  
This is essentially Apple Care for au, at, you guessed it, ¥300 per month. Five year repair warranty, discounted repairs on stuff not covered by warranty, discounted replacement costs, two free batteries over four years, and extra points. It&#8217;s actually not a bad deal for anyone who use a single handset for 3+ years, but for the rest of us, it&#8217;s just another sleazy fee. 

I was forced to sign up for this too. I canceled the next day.

**Everybody Discount**  
No it&#8217;s not the next Japanese dance craze. A few years ago, there was a &#8220;Wari&#8221; (discount) war between carriers, starting with a couples discount, followed by a family discount, then a students discount, second handset discount, a discount for the elderly, the left handed, and finally, gas station attendants with leap year birthdays. Au then decided that it&#8217;d be easier if they just gave a discount to \*everybody\*, but generously decided to keep all the other discounts, probably to take the sting off the second mortgage you take out to pay off all those ¥300 yen fees. 

Believe it or not, Everybody Discount doesn&#8217;t cost anything, but is only available if you lock yourself in for two years. Wait, didn&#8217;t they cover that with Full Support?

**In Conclusion**  
For all the convenience the mobile phone industry provides me, it has few competitors for my disgust. I&#8217;d like to believe that their convoluted games were forced by some genuinely unavoidable industry-specific economic factors that I&#8217;m unaware of, but deep down I suspect that they&#8217;d rather [nickel and dime profits][1] out of their customers with useless add-ons and devious pricing schemes than earn it through good ideas.

**Postscript on the green infobar**  
Undeterred, I hit Ito Yokado yesterday, where I&#8217;d seen the model in stock the previous week. It was still available, but alas, only available to new customers. Apparently, after 6 years and $6000 of loyalty to au, I&#8217;m only worthy of grey or red & white check.

*Update: This post used to include the Japanese terms for these crazy plans, but WordPress chewed them up when I upgraded to v 2.7. Unfortunately, (or fortunately?) I don&#8217;t remember what they were called*
