[![Screenshot from new AQ][1]][2]We relaunched [AQ&#8217;s website][2] a few weeks back. 

This website was long overdue. Although the old site neatly summarized what we do in 4 pages with no navigation, the flat architecture and minimal design gave our audience few visual clues on what kind of site they were looking at, how to interact with it, or what kind of people were behind it. 

With [the new site][2], we filled in these blanks, and indulged in some features that will inspire us to be a bit more talkative: a CMS, a blog, and dynamic language management. 

We have a few exciting posts cooking up for the [blog][3], so don&#8217;t forget to grab the [rss feed][4]!

Big thanks to Christophe for fighting the WP beast into bilingual submission, Eiko for the sweet illustrations, and [Paul][5] for guidance and proofreading.
