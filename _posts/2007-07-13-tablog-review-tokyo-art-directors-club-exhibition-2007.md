[![null][1]][2]My first article for TABlog was just published: a review of the Tokyo Art Director&#8217;s Club exhibition at Ginza Graphic Gallery, in the form of 6 suggestions. 

&#8220;Award shows are tough to get right. They have no over-arching narrative, no common aesthetic, and enjoyment by the general public is only one of their purposes. But they are also a great opportunity to put the current thinking and values of an industry on display, improving awareness of how design works, and when itâ€™s working.

The ADC and Ginza Graphic Gallery could be doing a lot more to embrace this opportunity. [Here are a few suggestions on how.][2]&#8221;
