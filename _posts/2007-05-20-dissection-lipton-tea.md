[![Lipton Ad][1]][2]As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s generally considered bad manners in Japan to eat, and to a much lesser degree, drink outside. 

There are of course several allowances. Anything served at outdoor festivals, quick shots of [canned coffee][3]. But outside of these, you just don&#8217;t see Japanese people put much to their mouth outside of homes and restaurants.

This makes perfect sense to me. When they can, the Japanese like to take their time with meals. They fuss over presentation, balance and sequence. There is a whole vocabulary for eating that spans past the easy senses of taste and smell, into touch and hearing. How could any of this possibly be enjoyed wedged between meetings on opposite sides of town?

Besides, in many less restrained cultures than Japan, eating is the most flamboyant bodily function that humans can engage in with mixed company. Eating outside imposes all kinds of potential irritations on strangers. Maybe they haven&#8217;t eaten yet today, so your soft bite into an onigiri taunts them. Maybe they just ate, so the smell of your [everything bagel][4] nauseates them. Or maybe they&#8217;re just having a really bad day, and the last thing they need is for you to spray droplets of melted banana java chip Frappucino onto their suit jacket while they hang from the hand straps in a Ginza Line subway car, gently swaying. 

But this has been a tough adjustment for me. I survived the last eight or so years of my schooling eating chunks of bagels in the back of math class, food that requires utensils while driving, and entire fast food meals while jogging across campus. In Japan, I struggle to delay gratification until I find a quiet, stationary stage for the performance of a 3-part symphony of mixed sandwiches.

Which is why [this ad][2] in Kudanshita station touched me so. A single line of copy and a simple photograph together defy all this nonsense and make it ok again for me to inhale soft serve in front of [ampm][5].
