[![][1]][2]My band [dryfishbutterfly][3] updated our site after a long slumber. New photos and new previews of the album we&#8217;re working on. 

We just finished recording the last track and are searching for a mixing/mastering studio to finish the job. The indie recording scene in Tokyo is still a mystery to me, any pointers out there?
