[This is an impressive piece of email communication][1] from the White House. 

The email aims to debunk myths about the U.S. health care reform bill by explicitly co-opting the format in which these myths are disseminated: a forward-friendly email of memorable bullet points. This brilliant choice allowed them to cram a lot of information about a complex, emotional, scary topic into something digestible. 

They&#8217;ve also managed to nail a bunch of other great practices for email newsletter writing: 

<ul class="tight">
  <li>
    Sincere, approachable, jargon-free writing style
  </li>
  <li>
    Sets clear expectations of length, structure and content early on (4th paragraph)
  </li>
  <li>
    Groups ideas under subheadings.
  </li>
  <li>
    One idea per paragraph
  </li>
  <li>
    Short paragraphs
  </li>
  <li>
    Moderate, consistent link density
  </li>
  <li>
    Restrained use of graphics
  </li>
</ul>

My only gripe with it is consistency. The section titled &#8220;8 common myths about health insurance reform&#8221; mixes restatement (e.g. &#8220;We can’t afford reform&#8221;) and refutation (e.g. &#8220;Vets&#8217; health care is safe and sound&#8221;), effectively reinforcing the myths, weakening the refutations or both for less careful readers.
