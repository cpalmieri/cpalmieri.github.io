[![][1]][2]My friend Ashley stopped by the office this rainy afternoon to take a few head shots for upcoming activities that blossomed out of [Art Space Tokyo][3], a book he created with [Craig][4] this winter. 

These guys are headed to New York next month for the US release party. They worked their butts off on this one, and it shows in the writing and design. Wish them luck!
