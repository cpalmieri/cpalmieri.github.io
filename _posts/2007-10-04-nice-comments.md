[![][1]][2]<a href=http://blog.disqus.net/2007/09/08/geez-when-are-you-guys-launching-already/#disqus_thread">This</a> is a pretty smart re-ordering of comment fields.

Classic Comments Form interaction:  
&#8220;I have something to say about this!&#8221;  
&#8220;Okey Dokey, just fill out these thr. . &#8221;  
&#8220;Argggh!&#8221;

So let people get the thought in their mind on screen first and take names later. (Although the traditional ordering could be seen as the comment form equivelent of the Brady Bill.)
