My name is Chris Palmieri.  
I&#8217;m an American designer, [eating breakfast in Tokyo][1] since 2001. 

I don&#8217;t update this website much, but have left its [fifty odd writings][2] here for your enjoyment. These days, I do most of my writing which is not email on [my company’s blog][3] and on [Twitter][4].

**Quick timeline**

*1977–1996*  
I grew up in a big Italian-American family in New Jersey who I don&#8217;t visit nearly enough. In high school, I played bass in a few bands and got my ass kicked on the wrestling team.

*1996–2001*  
I attended the University of Illinois, where I studied [graphic design][5], Japanese, and [Ikebana][6]. I played bass and keyboards in a few bands. I worked as a designer at a [NY e-commerce startup][7] and the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications][8].

*2001–2003*  
I moved to Tokyo, taught English for a few years, learned how to design in Japanese. I joined another band called [dryfishbutterfly][9].

*2004–present*  
I co-founded [AQ][11], a team of digital product designers with studios in Tokyo and Paris. Recently we&#8217;ve been helping startups grow their business through better user experience design.

I also contribute design and product management to [Tokyo Art Beat][13], Tokyo’s best resource for art and design event information. Over the last seven years, I&#8217;ve helped design TAB’s [website][14], [free paper][15], and [best-selling iPhone apps][16].

I co-created [Hi][17], an online storytelling community.
