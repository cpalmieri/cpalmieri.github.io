<h1>ArtJ 398: Designing Everyday Life in Modern Japan</h1>
	<p><a href="https://japanhouse.illinois.edu/">Japan House</a> at the University of Illinois</br>Instructor: Chris Palmieri</br>Spring 2022</p>
  
<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p><a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2022/spring/ARTJ/398">ArtJ 398</a> is an introduction to the modern history of Japanese design from 1920 - Present, its role in continuously reshaping everyday life in Japan as well as the individual and collective identity of its people.</p>

<p>Throughout the course, we engage with design artifacts, read works of aesthetic theory by designers and scholars, and hear from current day designers working in Japan.</p>

<p>We do this to build competence in critical analysis of design artifacts and the narratives used to frame them; to learn to place and connect design within its historical and cultural context; and to examine the aesthetic choices and defaults in our own environment and creative practices.</p>
