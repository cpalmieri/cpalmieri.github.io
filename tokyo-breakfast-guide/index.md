<p style="color:#bbb;">
  Starting the day with a solid breakfast in Japan can be tough, unless you cook or go to hotel. <span style="color:#aaa">Most restaurants and cafés don&#8217;t serve the most important meal of the day, and the ones that do usually open their doors around nine o&#8217;clock.</span>
</p>

<p style="color:#999">
  Now, eating breakfast at home is surely one of the many habits that keep the Japanese lean and alive. <span style="color:#888">But if you grew up anywhere near a highway spotted with greasy spoons, like me, you sometimes wake up with aching to tear through a plate of eggs,</span><span style="color:#777"> while catching up on all that has happened in the world while you slept, in the warm company of a room full of strangers whose left eye is also still half shut.</span>
</p>

<p style="color:#666">
  There <em>are</em> places to do just that in Tokyo. <em>Most</em> are not worth rolling out of bed for. These are:
</p>

## [Cafe Mame-Hico][1]

Thick, dense toast with comforting toppings like azuki & butter and ham & cheese. A real salad. Strong coffee by the cup or pot. Quiet and laptop friendly. A five minute walk from Shibuya Station.

## [Ueshima Coffee][2]

Eggs, bacon, thick toast and a slightly sad salad with decent coffee. Among the chains, it&#8217;s your best option. Quiet and laptop friendly. Throughout Tokyo.

## [Factory][3]

Assorted homemade breads, Koiwa yogurt, eggs topped with salsa, juices and coffee. Uncomfortable seating, but a great deal. A ten minute walk from Kudanshita or Ichigaya Station.

## [Kojimachi Cafe][4]

Weekend brunch includes lentil soup, fried bananas, cornmeal pancakes and other creative dishes made from organic ingredients. Illy coffee and espresso drinks. A stones throw from Hanzomon Station.

## [Bread, Espresso &][5]

A perfect macchiato, french toast and panini-style sandwiches, with an open storefront to watch the pretty people wobble past. A ten minute walk from Gaienmae or Omotesando Station.

## [Good Morning Cafe][6]

Eggs & Toast, acai fruit bowl, french toast or the *classic* Japanese breakfast (a hot dog). A five minute walk from Sendagaya Station.

## [Bondi Cafe][7]

Pancakes, omlettes, fruit bowls and steamed veggies. Big leather couches, outdoor or indoor seating. A little pricey, but a relaxing place to start your day. A three minute walk from Hiroo Station.

## [Maruichi Bagel][8]

The *only* legit New York bagel in Tokyo. This is the real deal. Open five days a week from seven. A five minute walk from Shirokane-Takanawa Station.

## [Pure Café][9]

Serves vegan breakfasts: toast with unsweetened peanut butter, rice salad, muffins, along with fresh-made juices. Their coffee needs improvement, so you&#8217;re best to getting your caffeine fix elsewhere. A few minutes from Omotesando Station.

## [Bubby&#8217;s][10]

Big, fluffy pancakes topped with fresh fruit, eggs benedict, apple pie, and other American classics served with bottomless coffee. Three locations near Roppongi-Itchome, Tokyo Station (Yaesu side), and Yokohama. 

## [Beacon][11]

A generously portioned, fancy schmancy take on classic American sunday brunch. A favorite among splurgy expats. In Omotesando.

## [Lauderdale][12]

Order their perfectly fat-crisped pancakes with fruit. Beware of cinnamon on the cappuccino. Across from the Hyatt in Roppongi Hills.

*A full stack of thanks to [Craig][14], [Luis][15] and [Gen][16] who introduced me to several of these places, as well as [Paul][17], [Eiko][18], [Raphaël][19] and any other Tokyoite I ever dragged out of bed before noon on a perfectly good Sunday.*
